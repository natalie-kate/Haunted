                        <p>My friend and I were staying over at another friends for a night out. It was an old
                            building, used as student flats. We were getting ready to go out when I saw a wee
                            boy
                            walking behind me in the mirror, I instantly looked but there was no one there. I
                            never
                            said anything to anyone as I didn’t want to sound silly but in the middle of the
                            night
                            my friend woke up to the wee boy standing watching us sleep!

                            through
                            the back to do paperwork. It was quiet so I was reading a magazine at the checkout
                            when
                            I heard my boss walk through and I seen her standing at the other side of the desk
                            in my
                            peripheral vision. “You finished already?” I asked, she didn’t reply and so I
                            started to
                            repeat my question as I looked up. There was no one there, my boss was in her office
                            and
                            hadn’t left.

                        </h3>
                        <p>I got home one night when I was still living with my mum and sister and all the
                            lights
                            were
                            off. So I settled down to watch a movie when I heard footsteps across my mums
                            bedroom
                            floor
                            and the distinctive sound of her wardrobe door opening, I went upstairs calling out
                            as I
                            went
                            “oh you are in!" When I got upstairs there was no one there, I was so scared. I
                            paced
                            the
                            floor, ready to run if I needed to, I just burst into tears when they finally walked
                            through
                            the door.<br><small>Naomi, Ayrshire</small></p>

                                I kept seeing a cat out the corner of my eye in the house, I put it down to my
                                imagination until one night he asked me if I’d seen a cat in the house, turns out
                                he’d
                                been seeing it too and didn’t want to scare me.

                                needing some water. As I walked towards the kitchen/living room area I could hear a
                                party going on, it wasn’t out of the ordinary I just wasn’t loving the idea of walking
                                into a party in my pj’s. I opened the door and the noise stopped abruptly, the lights
                                were out and there was no one there.

                                whole time, and went into the cupboard. My
                                flat was in an old converted hospital, I think he must have been a patient and died

                            <p>I used to work in a shoe shop and after I’d been on a night out, if the taxi queue
                                was too long or the weather was awful I would go into the shop (against the rules
                                I know but I was tipsy and had the keys). On <strong>two</strong> occasions I ran
                                out of there, there was a basement which was used as a stockroom, I would hear
                                banging and boxes falling, the second time piles of boxes upstairs also started
                                falling over. Didn’t even put them back I just jumped over them and bolted! This
                                as a very old street in an old market town, so not too surprising.

                            <p>I was staying in Jamaica at the Rose Hall resort, I was asleep and was woken by my
                                phone,
                                which was across the room. I got up to get it and I noticed that there looked to be
                                a
                                figure of a woman wearing a yellow top at the end of my bed, I thought that it was
                                clothes over the back of a chair that due to the dark looked like a figure. As I got
                                closer the figure didn’t transform into clothes like I assumed it would, instead she
                                turned her head to continue watching me cross the room. I freaked out and ran back
                                to
                                the bed and dove under the covers, I was awake for hours and didn’t re-emerge until
                                my
                                mum woke up for the toilet. Found out years later that the grounds of Rose Hall are

                            <p>I used to babysit for a friend, the baby was maybe a year old at the time. One time I
                                went in to check on her and her dolls pram was inside her cot, there is no way she could
                                climb out her cot never mind back in carrying a pram. Another time I went in and the
                                wallpaper border had been ripped off all around the room! When she was a bit older she
                                kept staring into the corner of the room and it wasn’t until I asked what she was
                                looking
