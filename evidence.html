                        <p>I was saying over at a friends in her uni halls when I woke in the small hours
                            needing some water. As I walked towards the kitchen/living room area I could hear a
                            party going on, it wasn’t out of the ordinary I just wasn’t loving the idea of walking
                            into a party in my pj’s. I opened the door and the noise stopped abruptly, the lights
                            were out and there was no one there.

                            kicking my legs out to get away, and he just walked backwards and into the cupboard. My
                            flat was in an old converted hospital.<br><small>Rachel, London</small></p>

                        <p>I used to babysit for a friend, the baby was maybe a year old at the time. One time I
                            went in to check on her and her dolls pram was inside her cot, there is no way she could
                            climb out her cot never mind back in carrying a pram. Another time I went in and the
                            wallpaper border had been ripped off all around the room! When she was a bit older she
                            kept staring into the corner of the room and it wasn’t until I asked what she was
                            looking
                            at that she replied “who’s that lady?” Didn’t babysit much after that!

                        <p>My friend had bought a house and I had agreed to move in with him. When we first moved in
                            I kept seeing a cat out the corner of my eye in the house, I put it down to my
                            imagination until one night he asked me if I’d seen a cat in the house, turns out he’d
                            been seeing it too and didn’t want to scare me.

                        <p>I was working the shop floor myself and my boss, (the only other person in) went through
                            the back to do paperwork. It was quiet so I was reading a magazine at the checkout when
                            I heard my boss walk through and I seen her standing at the other side of the desk in my
                            peripheral vision. “You finished already?” I asked, she didn’t reply and so I started to
                            repeat my question as I looked up. There was no one there, my boss was in her office and
                            hadn’t left.

                        <p>I was staying in Jamaica at the Rose Hall resort, I was asleep and was woken by my phone,
                            which was across the room. I got up to get it and I noticed that there looked to be a
                            figure of a woman wearing a yellow top at the end of my bed, I thought that it was
                            clothes over the back of a chair that due to the dark looked like a figure. As I got
                            closer the figure didn’t transform into clothes like I assumed it would, instead she
                            turned her head to continue watching me cross the room. I freaked out and ran back to
                            the bed and dove under the covers, I was awake for hours and didn’t re-emerge until my
                            mum woke up for the toilet. Found out years later that the grounds of Rose Hall are
                            haunted as Ghost Adventures did a programme on it.<br><small>Lindsey, Manchester</small>

                        <p>My friend and I were staying over at another friends for a night out. It was an old
                            building, used as student flats. We were getting ready to go out when I saw a wee boy
                            walking behind me in the mirror, I instantly looked but there was no one there. I never
                            said anything to anyone as I didn’t want to sound silly but in the middle of the night
                            my friend woke up to the wee boy standing watching us sleep!

                        <p>I used to work in a shoe shop and after I’d been on a night out, if the taxi queue was too
                            long or the weather was awful I would go into the shop (against the rules I know but I was
                            tipsy and had the keys). On <strong>two</strong>occasions I ran out of there, there was a
                            basement which was used as a stockroom, I would hear banging and boxes falling, the second
                            time piles of boxes upstairs also started falling over. Didn’t even put them back just
                            jumped
                            over them and bolted! This as a very old street in an old market town, so not too
                            surprising.

                        <p>I got home one night when I was still living with my mum and sister and all the lights were
                            off. So I settled down to watch a movie when I heard footsteps across my mums bedroom floor
                            and the distinctive sound of her wardrobe door opening, I went upstairs calling out as I
                            went
                            “oh you are in!" When I got upstairs there was no one there, I was so scared. I paced the
                            floor, ready to run if I needed to, I just burst into tears when they finally walked through
                            the door.<br><small>Naomi, Ayrshire</small></p>
