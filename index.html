                        <p> This site is for anyone interested in the paranormal. Paranormal is defined as events that
                            are beyond explanation<sup>1</sup>. In the last
                            decade or so ghost hunting programs have been gaining popularity and there are lots! But the
                            fascination with ghost, spirits and hauntings has been popular for <strong>alot</strong>
                            longer. On this site I want to give you an introduction into this fascinating subject and
                            let you decide: <br><em>Do you believe in Ghosts?</em></p>
                    
                        <h2 class="text-center" id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                        <p> Belief in the paranormal is an ancient one, it is even mentioned in the bible, and is the
                            main
                            storyline of thousands of pieces of literature and films.<sup>2</sup><br> In Victorian
                            England
                            spiritualism took
                            off in a big way especially among the ladies of the upperclass, with Queen Victoria herself
                            participating in spiritualist seances along with Prince Albert.<sup>3</sup> It wasn't until
                            1882 that the society for psychical research was started, prominant figures were Henry
                            Sidgwick
                            (Philosopher), William Barnett (physicist), Lord Raleigh (Nobel prize winner), Arthur
                            Balfour
                            (Philosopher and Prime Minister) and the original female ghostbuster Eleanor
                            Sidgwick<sup>4</sup>.
                            <br>Anthroplogists
                            have found that belief in ghosts is almost universal and is present in various ways in
                            almost
                            every culture.<sup>5</sup> Interestingly it was found that belief is strong enough among
                            Chinese
                            and Thai tourists that it becomes a travel barrier to places that have had disasters, it is
                            perceived as psychologically unsafe.<sup>6</sup></p>

                        <h4 class="left-text">Intelligent</h4>
                        <p>In intelligent hauntings the ghost appears to be aware of the living world, directly
                            interacting with people and objects within the environment. This includes answering
                            questions with appropriate answers, although these are generally only a few words at most.
                            People report objects moving, doors opening and being touched such as choked, pushed or
                            tugged at. These kinds of hauntings make up
                            76% of cases. A rare subtype is an anniverary haunting where the spirit appears on their
                            birthday or other personal date.<sup>7</sup>
                        </p>
                        <h4 class="left-text">Residual</h4>
                        <p>A residual haunting is one in which the ghost isn't aware of people or the environment,
                            unlike intelligent hauntings repeated experiences are often the same or very similar. e.g
                            the sound of footsteps going up the stairs and the sound of a door closing (no door actually
                            moves though). A rare subtype of a residual haunting is a historical haunting, an example of
                            this is hearing the sounds of fighting or seeing spectral soldiers at an old battle
                            field.<sup>7</sup>

                        <p>The premise of this is that traumatic events, or those which result in elevated emotional
                            states can imprint on the environment with the energy that is produced. The minerals and
                            chemicals in the stone around us act like the tape, which can be triggered to replay when
                            the environment or energy is similar to when it was created.<sup>8</sup></p>
                        <h4 class="left-text">Water Tape Theory</h4>
                        <p>This is basically the same but that it's the water in the environment, which is present in
                            everything including, bricks and stones that has the capability of acting like a magnetic
                            tape to record the events.</p>

                            induced hallucinations.<br>Verbal suggestion and the power of belief, i.e because you've
                            been told somewhere is haunted you are more likely to have an experience or you see a ghost
                            because you want to.<br>Another is electromagnetic fields, which have been found to be
                            unusual in places that are haunted. Its been hypothesised that these magnetic fields cause
                            unusual activity in the brain which may lead to people perceiving a presence.<sup>9</sup>
