# Haunted Website

BADGES?

Here is a link to the live project. (https://natalie-kate.github.io/haunted/)

This website was created for Milestone 1- User Centric Frontend Development project, as part of the Code Institutes diploma in Software development.
 I wanted to create a site that provided information for people interested in the paranormal, in particular ghosts.

## User Experience (UX)

   ### Site Goals
   User goals gained from a small survey.
   - As a user I want to be able to learn about ghosts and hauntings.
   - As a user who believes in the paranormal I want to read true stories and contribute my own.

   - As a user I would want to read theories as what could cause paranormal phenomona.

   - As the site owner I want to teach people about the fascinating world of the paranormal, in particular hauntings and ghosts.
   - As the site owner I want to collect evidence of the paranormal e.g stories, pictures and videos.

   - ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        In project inception I looked at possibly a logo for my site on Wix. While I ultimately didn't go with the logo I 
        did find a colour scheme. I wanted to create an atmosphere, not too dark as to create a scary feel, horror is not 
        what we're aiming but not too cheery at the same time. 

        ![Colour scheme](readmeimages/colour-scheme.png)

        The navy/very dark purple and the purple set the tone. The grey is used for the nav and footer providing contrast 
        for the brand name and menu and was picked from the hero image. The very pale green is used to lift and highlight, 
        where as the darker green is used on the badges and for the keyboard focus outline to draw attention. The dark green
        was also used for the hover style of the reference sup element, as the writing is small it was hard to distinguish 
        the colour change from purple to the darker purple used on the other elements.
        
    -   #### Typography
        For the headers the font family is Noto Sans KR imported from Google fonts. To complement it I chose Montserrat 
        from the popoular pairings section of their website. I chose these as they are easy to read and do not distract 
        from the content itself. In addition they go well with the feel that I want to achieve, others would have not 
        suited the subject matter.
          
    -   #### Imagery
        The hero image was chosen for the moodyness the colours and the castle ruins portray. It conveys the sort of place
        that you would imagine to be haunted without being scary and putting people off the site. Similarly the header 
        image in the other two pages has the heavy purple clouds with the spooky ruins drawing you in. 
        The font-awesome ghost "Casper" is again to highlight that this is a light hearted site, not to be taken too seriously.
    
    -   #### Design choices
        I decided to use pictures, text, table and fact boxes in my design. Different ways of presenting information is 
        visually more interesting to a user and makes it easier to pick out sections to look at. As an information site I 
        wanted the content to be there for who is interested but also aware that some people will skip over paragraphs of 
        text so tried to use the design to break up the information into easier to digest sections.
