# Haunted Website

BADGES?

Here is a link to the live project. ()

This website was created for Milestone 1- User Centric Frontend Development project, as part of the Code Institutes diploma in Software development.
 I wanted to create a site that provided information for people interested in the paranormal, in particular ghosts.
